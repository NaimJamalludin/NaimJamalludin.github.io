* Naim's Website

This is my personal website. I'm using =emacs= and =org-mode= to create this
website.

** Publish guide

To publish the website from =org-mode=, simply open your terminal and execute
the following command

#+begin_src bash
  cd NaimJamalludin.github.io
  make
#+end_src

This will create html files located in =public= folder.
