* Naim's Website

This is my personal website repository. I'm using =emacs= and =org-mode= to create this
website.

** Installation guide

For Windows operating system, it is recommended to have =cholocatey= package
manager comes pre-install in the system before proceeding to the next step. If
=cholocatey= package manager have already installed, execute the following
command to install =GNU Make= application to simplify the publishing process.

#+begin_src shell
choco install make
#+end_src

** Development guide

To begin developing the website, you must first clone the repository by
executing the following command:

#+begin_src shell
git clone https://github.com/NaimJamalludin/NaimJamalludin.github.io.git
#+end_src

All changes should be done in =src= folder.

** Publish guide

To publish the website from =org-mode=, simply open your terminal and execute
the following command:

#+begin_src shell
make
#+end_src

This will create html files located in =public= folder.
